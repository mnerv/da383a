# Digital Signal Processing University labs

The lab includes low pass filter and digital filter FIR and IIR. A simple DFT
and FFT (recursive and iterative) implementation.

## Labs

### Lab01 - Low-pass filter

Low-pass filter with passive components. The ESP32 on sample and output the sampled signal.

### Lab05 and Lab06 DFT and FFT

Lab 05 contains implementation for FFT and DFT in C++ and Python. It includes a
run.sh for the C++ version and the python version can be run like a script.

C++ version writes out the plot data for frequency and time domain.
